#### Problem Statement:
    Given Two Matrices A(r1 x c1) and B(r2 x c2). Write multi-threaded programs for matrix-multiplication to obtain Matrix C(r1 x c2).

##### Task1:
    *   Create r1*c2 threads and assign one position of Matrix C to each thread excusively.
    *   Files : Imp1.c (Code) | input1.txt, input2.txt, input3.txt (TestCase)
